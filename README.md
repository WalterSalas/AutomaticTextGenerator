# AutomaticTextGenerator
The goal of this project is to develop an application that uses the OpenAI API to automatically generate text. To achieve this, we will use natural language processing (NLP) technology and machine learning algorithms to train a model that can produce high-quality, coherent text based on a given prompt or topic.


The project will involve the following steps:
Setting up an OpenAI API account and obtaining an API key.
Preprocessing text data to ensure it is in a suitable format for use with the OpenAI API.
Using the OpenAI API to generate text based on a given prompt or topic.
Fine-tuning the model using additional training data to improve the quality of the generated text.
Developing a user interface (UI) that allows users to input a prompt or topic and receive generated text as output.
Throughout the project, you will learn how to work with the OpenAI API, use NLP techniques to process and analyze text data, and train machine learning models to generate text. You will also gain experience with software development tools and technologies, such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Flask, which will be used to build the application and UI.
