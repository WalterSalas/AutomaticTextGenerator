# AutomaticTextGenerator
The goal of this project is to develop an application that uses the OpenAI API to automatically generate text. To achieve this, we will use natural language processing (NLP) technology and machine learning algorithms to train a model that can produce high-quality, coherent text based on a given prompt or topic.
